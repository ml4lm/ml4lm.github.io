                Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model 
                fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working 
                with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language 
                model alignment. In this talk, I will introduce a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a 
                constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed \textit{Self-Play Preference Optimization} 
                (SPPO), approximates the Nash equilibrium through iterative policy updates and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantee. Our method can 
                effectively increase the log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot be trivially 
                achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our 
                experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging 
                a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that 
                achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) 
                DPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external 
                supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models.

                In recent years, significant advancements have been made in protein function 
                prediction through machine learning. However, most methods limit themselves 
                to multi-classification, assigning predefined labels to proteins. This talk 
                presents Prot2Text, a groundbreaking approach that predicts protein functions 
                in a free text format, transcending traditional binary or categorical classifications. 
                Prot2Text leverages an encoder-decoder framework, combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 
                and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate diverse data types such as protein sequences, 
                structures, and textual annotations. This multimodal approach enables a comprehensive 
                representation of protein functions, allowing for the generation of detailed and precise 
                functional descriptions. We will discuss the evaluation of Prot2Text using a multimodal 
                protein dataset extracted from SwissProt and share empirical results demonstrating its 
                effectiveness. This work underscores the transformative potential of integrating GNNs and 
                LLMs, providing researchers with advanced tools for more accurate and nuanced function prediction 
                for both known and novel proteins.

                Machine learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several 
                scientific phenomena. Much of the current progress is driven by scale and, conveniently, many scientific questions require analyzing 
                massive amounts of data. At the same time, in scientific applications predictions are often incorporated into broader analysis to draw 
                new insights that are causal in nature. In this talk I will explore the role of scale in causal analyses. I will start by showing it is 
                possible to extract causal knowledge from a pre-trained statistical model that was trained without causal considerations. Next, I will
                discuss when, how, and why causal directions can be directly predicted by transformers trained with supervised learning in a controlled 
                synthetic setting. Finally, I will discuss the open challenges solving real-world causal downstream tasks in the sciences. For this, I 
                will present ISTAnt, the first real-world benchmark for estimating causal effects from high-dimensional observations in experimental ecology.

                Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain. Initial LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses. Recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses. However, they are limited to only referring to a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding. In this talk, I will talk about Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input. This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of visually Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG), we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations. Further, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using an automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks, e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.

Secondly, he will introduce "coco-mulla," the inaugural "controlnet" fashion model that adeptly applies content-based controls to large-scale audio generation tasks. Lastly, Gus will present Flute X GPT, which introduces LAUI (LLM-Agent User Interface) as a potential next-generation Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) paradigm after Graphical User Interface (GUI). This system capitalizes on a nuanced understanding of both users and tutorial software to innovate customized music-learning experiences.

                Language models (LMs) have been shown to leak information about their training data through sentence-level membership inference and reconstruction attacks. Understanding the risk of LMs leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has received less attention, which can be attributed to the false assumption that dataset curation techniques such as scrubbing are sufficient to prevent PII leakage. Scrubbing reduces but does not prevent the risk of PII leakage. We introduce game-based definitions for three types of PII leakage via black-box extraction, inference, and reconstruction attacks with only API access to the LM. Our main contributions are: (i) novel attacks that can extract up to 10 times more PII sequences than existing attacks, (ii) showing that sentence-level differential privacy reduces the risk of PII disclosure but still leaks about 3% of PII sequences, and (iii) a subtle connection between record-level membership inference and PII reconstruction. I will summarize challenges with privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LMs, describe our proposed solutions, and provide an outlook on challenges and promising future research directions to protect sensitive information in LMs.
